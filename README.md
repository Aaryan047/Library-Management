# Library-Management

This is a very basic project on a library management system.
Steps to run:
1. Download all the files and keep them in the same folder.
2. Install a C++ Compiler (MinGW recommended).
3. Install a code editor (preferred CLion or Visual Studio Code).
4. Run the Main.cpp file, and the code will work, ta-da!

What to expect in the future:
1. Moving this project from just file-based to MySQL.
2. Adding a "Search by Author" feature.
3. Better display of books.
4. An interactive web page to login and work with.
